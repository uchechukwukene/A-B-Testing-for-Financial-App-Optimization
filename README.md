# A/B Testing for Financial App Optimization

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of **A/B testing** techniques to optimize the performance and user experience of a financial application. By testing different variations of features, UI components, and workflows, this analysis aims to determine which version of the app performs better in terms of user engagement and financial conversion metrics.

Through a well-structured approach, this project helps measure the impact of different versions (A: Control, B: Variant) on user behavior, conversion rates, and revenue outcomes, allowing data-driven decisions for app optimization.
