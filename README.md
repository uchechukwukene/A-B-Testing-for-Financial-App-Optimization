#Project Title
A/B Testing for Financial App Optimization

Project Description
This project demonstrates how A/B testing can be used to optimize the performance of a financial application. It focuses on analyzing user interactions, optimizing conversion rates, and improving user engagement with different features of the app. By testing variations of the app interface, feature sets, and user flows, we can determine which version performs better and leads to higher user satisfaction and conversion.
